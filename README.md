# CS_114-Lab1-SumOfPreviusNum

<p>
 Write a Java program called SumOfPrevious.java that reads in two lines of input
from the standard input. The first line contains a single positive integer n, and the
second line contains n positive integers separated by spaces. The program should
use your recursive method to determine if the second input line contains an integer
that is the sum of two integers appearing earlier in the line. If so, your program
should print out \true"; otherwise it should print out \false".
